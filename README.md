# Metro Route Optimization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing metro routes using C++ and Dijkstra's algorithm. It incorporates Route files, MetroSystem files, and Stations files to efficiently manage metro station data and find the shortest paths between stations.

## Technologies Used
- **C++:** For algorithm implementation and data handling
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** For shortest path computation

## Features
- User-friendly interface for inputting start and end stations
- Visualization of the shortest path within the metro network
- Integration with Route files, MetroSystem files, and Stations files for comprehensive data management

## How to Use
1. Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler.
2. Ensure Route files, MetroSystem files, and Stations files are correctly formatted.
3. Run the executable and follow the prompts to input start and end stations.
4. The system will display the optimized route, including the number of stations and total distance.

## Project Structure
- **`main.cpp`:** Contains the main code for metro route optimization.
- **`RouteFile.csv`:** CSV file containing route data.
- **`MetroSystemFile.csv`:** CSV file containing metro system information.
- **`StationsFile.csv`:** CSV file containing station details.
